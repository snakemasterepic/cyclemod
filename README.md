Cycle
==
Cycle is a mod that is about making every resource in vanilla Minecraft renewable while blending into vanilla gameplay.

| Resource | Renewal Method |
| -- | -- |
| Ancient Debris | Enderman can spawn with it in the nether. |
| Banner Pattern (Snout) | Sniffers sniffing treasure (bastion). |
| Calcite | Can be crafted (crafted the same as diorite but with nautilus shells instead of quartz and gives 4 instead of 2 per craft) |
| Cobweb | Cave spiders can make cobwebs as they wander about. |
| Dead Bush | Can be obtained by bone mealing sand. |
| Deepslate, Cobbled Deepslate | Stone and cobblestone generators produce deepslate and cobbled deepslate respectively in the deep dark. |
| Disc Fragment | Sniffers sniffing treasure (ancient city). |
| Dragon Egg | The one resource this mod doesn't touch.  The fact that there is only one in an entire vanilla world means that it is meant to be a special trophy.  Therefore, I left just the one dragon egg.  If you want more, there are plenty of other mods that make dragon eggs renewable. |
| Dragon Head | Drops when the ender dragon is killed by a charged creeper. |
| Echo Shard | Sniffers sniffing treasure (ancient city). |
| Elytra | Sniffers sniffing treasure (end city). |
| Enchanted Book (Swift Sneak) | Sniffers sniffing treasure (ancient city). |
| Enchanted Golden Apple | Sniffers sniffing treasure. |
| Gilded Blackstone | Sniffers sniffing treasure (bastion). |
| Heart of the Sea | Elder guardians drop them when killed by magic (such as harming potions or conduit). |
| Horse Armor (Iron, Gold, Diamond) | Sniffers sniffing treasure. |
| Music Disc (Otherside) | Sniffers sniffing treasure. |
| Music Disc (Pigstep) | Sniffers sniffing treasure. |
| Music Disc (Relic) | Sniffers finding suspicious sand/gravel (trail ruins). |
| Ores | Enderman sometimes spawn with ores them. |
| Pottery Shards | Sniffers finding suspicious sand/gravel. |
| Sand | (Already renewable in vanilla via wandering traders) Can now be obtained by smelting dirt. |
| Spore Blossom | Wandering traders sometimes sell them. |
| Tuff | Same rules as basalt generators but with soul sand instead of soul soil. |
| Wet Sponge | Guardians struck by lightning turn into elder guardians. |
